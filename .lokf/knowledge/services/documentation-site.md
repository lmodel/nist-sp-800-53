# Documentation site

`website/` holds an Astro Starlight site. `website/site.config.mjs` names the repository `lmodel/nist-sp-800-53`, the site `https://lmodel.github.io` with the base path `/nist-sp-800-53`, and the title `nist-sp-800-53`.[^site.config.mjs] It shows the pages of `docs/` but `docs/templates-linkml/`, and it redirects the addresses the retired mkdocs site gave its pages: `/elements` and every page under it to `/schema/`, and `/about` to `/docs/about/`. The other options take the site's defaults: the Knowledge Trust Ladder logo, the README as the home page, the changelog once it holds a release, and the schema's pages that `just gen-doc` writes.

`website/README.md` says what each page is built from, and that `npm run build` syncs the bundle, the README, the docs and the schema's pages before it builds and checks every link.[^website-readme.md] [Knowledge website](../workflows/knowledge-website.md) builds the site on each change to its sources and publishes it once `KNOWLEDGE_WEBSITE_ENABLED` is `true`.
